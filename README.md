# Income-KNN_TreeBased_Classifier-
For this project, we will be working on yearly income to: "Determine if an individual makes over 50K a year"
The data set was downloaded from Kaggle with 48842 instances (rows) and 15 attributes (columns), we hope to use these indicators to determine how much a person is or will be earning.
The final target that we want to achieve is to be able to determine if a person is earning more than $50,000/year based on certain features
This project will be divided into 3 parts:
1) First Part of the project will be just checking and getting to know the data.
2) Second Part is cleaning data.
3) Third Part is the data analysis.
